Welcome to the repo of my first ever project! This is a portfolio project that was done to complete the milestone assignment to proceed my 'career' as a Full-Stack Software Engineer. This project was done using vanilla CSS and with minimum interfention of AI (I hope). Using vanilla was meant for me to excercise more on the fundamentals. Feel free to navigate the site. Cheers!

## üí¶ Issues (or to Improve)
  - In a page where the content is not full vh, footer still not sit at the bottom
  - Will replace nav menu using a hamburger button when in mobile media query later (need `js`)
  - Bug in the carousel button (anchor button not correctly scrolls) (need `js`)
  - I divide the body into 3 divs to make the content only in the middle (instead of using max-width)
  - In general the base code of CSS and HTML is still a bit of a mess. The CSS is +1000 lines long. Will try to seperate CSS for each page after assignment review
  - Rare usage of ID, and minimum re-use of a class
  - Will change socials icons using `fontawesome`
