# Bejo's Portfolio Page
This is the readme file for my portfolio page. In this page I will explain about myself, my experiences, project I have worked on, and I put a way for you to reach me outðŸ˜‰.

To open the deployed page, click [here](https://revou-fsse-feb25.github.io/milestone-1-kebejoan/index.html)

>Note: If you have opened it before and a push happened from me, you might want to **right click and reload frame** on the 'body' page to show the content correctly

## Overview
In this page/html/repo(?) you can navigate to several pages to know me and to reach me out. Feel free to inspect the html element.

## Content
- [Assets folder](https://github.com/revou-fsse-feb25/milestone-1-kebejoan/tree/main/assets)
  
  contains asset for image and video displayed on the page/html/repo(?)

- [Pages folder](https://github.com/revou-fsse-feb25/milestone-1-kebejoan/tree/main/pages)
  
  contains html pages to be navigated to

- [home.html page](https://github.com/revou-fsse-feb25/milestone-1-kebejoan/tree/main/home.html)
  
  contains home (aboutme) page of the page/html/repo(?)

- [index.html page](https://github.com/revou-fsse-feb25/milestone-1-kebejoan/tree/main/home.html)
  
  contains main page of the page/html/repo(?)


## Features (and Issues)
- index.html uses 2 iframe-s that divide the page into two. looks good but I don't think it's propper. But hey, I want the 'sticky footer'.
- home.html is the default layouting without 'sticky footer'.
- for the sticky footer to show correctly, footer.html uses noscroll script. asked chatgpt to write a noscroll script to use.
- form for contact might be semanticly incorrect but I like the look (and the "posting" also hopefully works)
- h1 might be semanticly incorrect
- nav might be semanticly incorrect
- Vertical responsiveness is still incorrect
- Horizontal responsiveness still use percentage
- there is a use of deprecated attributes (align, valign)

## To Improve
- Use CSS for styling instead of table
